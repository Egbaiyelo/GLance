I need to make it allow for frustrums too 
Maybe model it so that one can use different methods for generating shapes
Maybe make so someone can specify different scales, like the axis can be made to be distorted.
Maybe help with vertices and UV coords and normals (options for these)
Maybe model matrices
Maybe model requests to allow for these
